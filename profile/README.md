# 🏗️ Architect Platform

**Your software architect in a box.**  
Architect helps developers build consistent, production-ready software with structure, standards, and automation — from the first commit to deployment.

---

## 🚀 What Does Architect Do?

- 📦 Scaffold projects with opinionated templates (e.g. Spring Boot, Kotlin).
- 🔐 Enforce architectural rules, code quality, and security checks.
- ⚙️ Automate CI/CD, testing, and versioning.
- 📈 Grow with your project — from local development to full cloud deployment.

Whether you're working solo or with a team, Architect helps you write better software faster.
